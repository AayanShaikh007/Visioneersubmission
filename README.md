# Head Tracking Mouse
A small program that uses head tracking to move your cursor and move around your pc hands free. 

# How This Works?
This project utilizes computer vision to track head movements and detect mouth openings using a webcam. By analyzing facial landmarks it translates these gestures into mouse movements and clicks, enabling hands-free control.​

# How to Run This?
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (pip): OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, and Keyboard. Run the script and it will access your webcam to start tracking.​ Use esc to exit the program.
